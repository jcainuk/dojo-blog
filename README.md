# Dojo-blog - A simple React app to post and edit blog entries

This project is a simple blog application that I worked through using the [Full Modern React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) from Youtube in order to learn about React from the ground up - setup, JSX templates, components & events. I covered state & the use of hooks, the React Router & also how to handle asynchronous code in components.

This project relies on a local JSON server to host the data rather making HTTP calls to an external API or database. You must open a second terminal to boot up and host the db.JSON files first.

## General info

The project covered the following concepts:

- React
- JSON server
- Making API calls
- Promises
- Manipulating the DOM
- Adding Event listeners and handling input events


## Technologies

- React
- Node and Node Package Manager
- eslint (eslint-config-airbnb-base, eslint-plugin-import) for code styling
- JSON


## Languages

- React and JSX
- JavaScript

## Scripts

## "start": "react-scripts start",
Open up your first terminal and use this to start the application. 


## "serve": "json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000",
Opening up a second terminal and using "npm run serve" you can host the JSON data in db.json locally.

## Dependencies

-  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.9",
-  "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.5",
-  "react": "^17.0.1",
-  "react-dom": "^17.0.1",

## Status

Project is: COMPLETE

## Inspiration

Project created as part of the [Full Modern React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) from Youtube. I used this to learn the fundamentals of React and experiment with a JSON server.

## Considerations

This app was designed purely for laptop and desktop computer screens. At the moment it does not work on smartphone screen so moving forward this might need to be fixed and taken into consideration. In addition, I neglected testing. This is something I would like to come back to later.
